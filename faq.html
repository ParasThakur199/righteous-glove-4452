                        This depends on the pricing plan that you select. If you go for the “Unlimited kms” pricing plans
                        (available only without fuel, and only for bookings whose duration is more than 72 hours), there is absolutely no 
                        limit to the kilometres that you can drive, and you have complete flexibility of driving the car as much as you want.
                         Revv it up! Other pricing plans have a "Kilometres limit", which varies based on the plan selected. You can still 
                         drive beyond the kilometres limit, but the additional kilometres clocked will attract an additional charge.

                        All of our cars are equipped with an All India Tourist Permit, so you are free to drive anywhere in the country.
                        All India Tourist Permit means that the car is legally permitted to ply in any state in the country, after paying
                         the inter-state taxes at the state borders. However, we do not permit taking Revv vehicles to Leh/Ladakh region,
                          Kaza/Nako region and spiti valley. We also advise you to avoid bad terrains (especially in non- SUV cars) and areas
                           affected by civil unrest.

                    <div  class="answers">
                        In the event of damages, your liability is limited to a maximum of Rs 10000. You will need to pay Damage Fee equivalent to the repair cost (as estimated by an authorized dealership) and downtime losses, upto a maximum of Rs 10000. This is independent of the nature and terms of the insurance cover that Revv has on the cars. 
                    
                        Please note that the maximum liability policy is intended to benefit and protect the responsible user. In situations of irresponsible or unsafe or negligent usage, there could be discretionary exceptions to this policy, whereby the user could be liable for all damages irrespective of whether or not Revv is able to claim insurance in such cases. Examples of such situation include, but are not limited to:

                        <li>When the User is not in compliance with the laws and/or with terms of the Revv User Agreement</li>    
                        <li>When the User is found to be under the influence of alcohol/narcotics while driving</li>    
                        <li> When the User is over-speeding (i.e. above prescribed speed limit of road or 125 Kms/Hr, whichever is lower)</li>   
                        <li> When the User is in violation of traffic rules or of the Motor Vehicles Act (for example, if the User has not paid the inter-state tax while crossing a state border)</li>  
                        <li>When the person driving the vehicle at the time of the incident is found to be different than the one who made the booking</li>   
                        <li>When the vehicle workshop and/or insurance company deem the damage to be consequential in nature (this will be clearly stated in the accident report). Consequential damage occurs when the User continues driving the vehicle even when it is performing abnormally</li>   
                        <li>When the number of people in the car at the time of the incident exceed the standard seating capacity of the car</li>   
                        <li>When the incident happened in a state for which the user had failed to pay the inter-state tax while entering the state</li>   
                        <li>When there is misrepresentation of information in the driving license and ID proof details shared by the user</li>   
                        <li>Where there is clear evidence of extremely rash and negligent driving on the user's part</li>   

                        In cases where the estimated damage charges exceed the security deposit, we will request the user to pay the same at the time of returning the car. In cases of non-payment, Revv reserves the right of legal action, reporting to credit bureau and reporting to other authorities or persons, irrespective of their direct relevance to the case.
                    
                        In cases of accident, fare for the unused hours will not be refunded.

                        Revv typically avoids charging for very minor damages (e.g., minor scratches and dents), and covers the vast majority of damage incidents under the maximum liability policy.

                        In cases of collision or User failure, towing and impounding charges will be paid by the User. In cases of vehicle failure, towing and impounding charges will be paid by us.

                        125 Kms/Hr is the speed limit. Exceeding it will attract a penalty for over-speeding. In some states 
                        (e.g., Karnataka, Maharashtra, Delhi-NCR), some cars might be equipped with speed governors, which will
                         automatically restrict the speed to 80Kms/Hr. This is as per government directives.
